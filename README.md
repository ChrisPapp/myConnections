# myConnections
This is a project for a course of the Department of Management Science and Technology in the Athens University of Economics and Business

myConnections is a platform that allows Organisations to check whether a Person is connected with them.

Use case:
A university registers as an "Organisation", and the student as Person.
The university can send a code to the student, and through the code the student can add the University to their Connections.
When the student needs to (e.g. take an exam), they can create and send a code to the University, which the University can use to identify the student.


Implemented using Django with the 'pillow' dependency.
